This came about after deciding that working with clients was not for me. I had a local SEO client who admitted he was a bit crazy when we first met. Who isn't? And besides, I could certainly use the money and put my knowledge of local SEO, GMB and so forth to good use. Without going into details, after getting a frantic text on Christmas Eve about his visibility in Google (it was right where I said it would be at that point) I decided to call it a day and tell him to hit the road.</p><p>That left me with one very reasonable client and some affilitate income from Clickbank. Not enough for my needs though. </p><p>So, I thought "Darn, didn't I get that course from Diggy and never finished it?" Yes indeed, so I plunged back into it with some new energy and focus.</p><h3>I'll Call It Six Figure Inc. 2.0</h3><p>Well, was I pleasantly surprised. Unlike some other course creators who put up a course and walk away, in my absence Diggy had done a total makeover on the membership site. All the initial modules were brand new so I decided to start over. </p><p>I just finished Module 3 which is as far as the new content goes as of early April 2019. Module 4 is coming out next week. If there was nothing more to it than that I'd feel that I'd received way more value than what the program cost. From the menu it appears that there will be 11 modules plus the bonuses.</p><h3>Six Figure Inc.

Find out more about Diggy on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/diggydirkofficial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook page.</a></p><h3>Review Summary </h3><p>Six Figure Inc. will teach you how to create the proper mindset for success, the best way to create an online business, how to choose a winning evergreen niche, how to do sales and marketing and much more.  </p><p>You may have heard that infoproducts are the way to go. I've known that for a long time but have never seen such a course that puts it all together in a way that I can follow. I already have a couple of ideas to start with but I'm going to wait until I complete the whole program before jumping in with both feet.</p><p>My favorite modules so far are niche selection and seven figure mistakes. Those two modules alone could both save you money from wasting your efforts on the wrong niche and make you a fortune by not missing little known revenue generation tips.</p><p>This Six Figure Inc. review will be updated as new modules are added. If you are interested in learning more, Diggy has an introductory webinar going every day.  </p><p><a href="https://1.kmg.link/bhv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here</a> to sign up for the free webinar.
