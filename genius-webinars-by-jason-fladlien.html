So Genius Webinars is an apt name for this course. He has sold over $100,000,000 worth of products on his webinars. My partner and I purchased an add-on course to a popular Amazon FBA program for $3497. Without Jason's webinar I doubt we would have been so inclined to spend the money. If you have or want to sell an information product or coaching program, Genius Webinars is worth serious consideration. My rating is 5/5. This program is not open on a regular basis but you can check the link below to see if it's available.
